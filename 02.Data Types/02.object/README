Object:
    In js, almost everything is an Object.

2.1. JavaScript Object properties
    Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.
    A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.
    Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

2.1.1 Accessing JavaScript Properties
    The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:
        objectName.property      // person.age
        
    or
        objectName["property"]   // person["age"]

    or
        objectName[expression]   // x = "age"; person[x]
