Object:
    In js, almost everything is an Object.

2.1. JavaScript Object properties
    Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.
    A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.
    Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

2.1.1 Accessing JavaScript Properties
    The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:
        objectName.property      // person.age
        
    or
        objectName["property"]   // person["age"]

    or
        objectName[expression]   // x = "age"; person[x]


2.1.2. Javascript for...in loop:
    The JS for..in statement loops through the properties of an object.
    Syntax:
    for (let variable in object){
        //code to be executed
    }

    The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each property.

    Ex. Looping thrugh the properties of an object.
    const person={
        fname = "John",
        lname = "Doe",
        age = 25
    };
    for(let x in person){
        txt t = person[x]
    }


2.1.3. Adding new properties
    you can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.

    Assume that the person object already exists you can then give it new properties:
