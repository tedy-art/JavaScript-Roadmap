Variables Scope:
    1) Block Scope
    2) Function Scope
    3) Global Scope

1) Block Scope:
    Before ES6(2015), JS had only Global and Function Scopes.
    ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
    These two kwywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

    Variables declared inside a {} Block cannot be accessed fro, outside the Block:
    
    Ex. let keyword
    {
        let x = 2;
    }
    // xcan NOT be used here
    console.log(x) //error


    var keyword:
    Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have Block Scope.

    Variables declared inside a {} Block can be accessed the from outside the Block.

    Ex. var keyword:
    {
        var x = 2;
    }
    //x CAN be used here
    console.log(x);
